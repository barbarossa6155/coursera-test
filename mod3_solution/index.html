		<p>Frida Kahlo was like a hurricane in a dress. She had dark brown hair and a single eyebrow that made her look permanently fierce. She thought in colours that didn’t exist, and her sadness could give birth to new worlds. Andy Warhol wore his face like people wear a hat. His hair was almost as white as the snow but he had eyes of deep black. He thought in all the colours of the rainbow. Painting bright reds and blues on paper, walls, and people. Stephen Hawking could own a room like a cat in a classroom. His glasses mirrored his cheery disposition and his wheelchair flattened the toes of his enemies. He thought in all the ways of the universe. Particles, protons, and parallel universes. Once children have become adept at describing real people, they’re well on their way to being able to create their own characters and dream up all sorts of exciting short stories. They’ll have to think about using descriptive writing in all sorts of fun ways, not just for people, but enchanting places and exciting plots. Describing a person in writing is just the tip of the iceberg. With lots of practice, children will be well on their way to writing the next bestseller, and it all started at school with a fun little writing project. Frida Kahlo was like a hurricane in a dress.
